# Fidilio-Web-Scraping-Project

This file is a part of project for Data Analysis Bootcamp that belongs to Quera.org

In this Project, all cafe & returants data such as rate,address,price rate, quality rate,... in 14 province were collected by scraping Fidilio.com

In the nex step, a sql database created and all scraped data insert into the created databse. Also an ORM is created for easier connection to our sql database.

The scraped data needed to be data preprocessed for further analysis. So some data such as Address, Phone Number & Neighbour were preprocessed by libraries like pandas & numpy.

In the final step, the clean data used to create some analytical dashboards by using Streamlit framework
